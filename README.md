# Node.js Express API

## Description

This is a simple Node.js application using Express.js to create a RESTful API. The application has two endpoints:
- A root endpoint (`/`) that returns a welcome message.
- An API endpoint (`/api/data`) that returns a JSON response with a message and a timestamp.
